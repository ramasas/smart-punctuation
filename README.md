## Technical Details

### Conversion Rules

The smart punctuation algorithm follows these rules:

1. **Double Quotes (`"`):**
   - Opening: After whitespace, start of line, or opening punctuation → `"`
   - Closing: All other cases → `"`

2. **Single Quotes (`'`):**
   - Contractions: Between letters (don't, can't) → `'`
   - Opening: After whitespace, start of line, or opening punctuation → `'`
   - Closing: All other cases → `'`

3. **Special Cases:**
   - Possessives ending in 's' → `'`
   - Years like '90s → `'`

### Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Frontend:** HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **API:** RESTful endpoint for text conversion
